# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Your Task

Our task this week was to build a terminal run application from scratch to help manage a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. We have been taught that coders help create interfaces that let non-coders manage information stored in databases called content management systems (CMS).

## Application

With this app, you are able to: 
    * View and update employee names, roles, and managers.
    * Assign roles to employees and adjust them as employees change roles or managers
    * Add employees, roles, and departments

## Usage

Install: 
  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
  [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Use [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install npm packages. 

In your project folder, open your terminal and install the following packages:

    "console-table-printer"
    "console.table"
    "figlet"
    "inquirer"
    "mysql2"

Double check to make sure that the MySQL database is connected and execute the schema and seeds.
